Probably the worst GPX route visualizer you will find. It works by looking for GPX files inside a "data" folder. No, it doesn't validate them. No, it doesnt handle errors. Then, it parses the routes and saves it on a map inside an html file, using Folium, changes the tab name and tries to display it in the default browser for convinience.
